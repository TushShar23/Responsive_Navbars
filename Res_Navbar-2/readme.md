- In this i have used event listener on WINDOW object and the event which i have used is "resize" for whenever user resize the window , sidebar should be remove from the window.
- In this project i have used google icons which are like fontawesome icons but google icons are free(like close button.If you are using fontawesome icons then thae close button is paid(which i have used) but it is free in google icons).
- backdrop-filter:blur(value) // used to give background a blur effect.
- innerWidth & innerHeight are the properties which are used in window object.As window object is not an html element style attribute is not associated with it.
