# Issues

```
There is no issue every functionality and resposiveness is working fine.

```

## Learnings

```
- Whenever you are working with some buttons that are used to open menus and close them ALWAYS USE classlist.toggle() and classlist.remove().
- I have added a simple yet cool animation on opening of menubar.
- Avoid using "element.style.display" property.It will create chaos(my POV).

```
