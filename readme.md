## Best Practise to make any responsive navbar/sidebar

```
The best practise to make any responsive navbar/sidebar till the date(03-04-2025) according to me is that make copy of the content you want to show in sidebar.Ex-navlinks,buttons etc.and then give styling and responsiveness to those elements.
