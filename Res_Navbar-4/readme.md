```
There is no issue(s) in the functionality and working of this navbar.Infact i would say that this is one of the best navbar i have made till now.
```

## Learnings

```
- You can use window object to manipulate(on resizing) the side navbar when media query is not fired.Let say you have put media query on width less than or equal to 400px but if you don't close the side navbar it is still visible when width is 600px or greater.So you can use window object to hide navbar automatically.

- You can use element.classlist.add() and remove() instead of directly using display property of any element.

- If you are using any background image try to take colors of background of buttons,hover:links etc. from that image.
